# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on predicting passenger survival aboard the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset includes various features, such as passenger demographics and ticket details, to build an accurate survival prediction model.

## Key Features:
- **Imported File**: Loaded the Titanic dataset for analysis.
- **Checked for Null Values**: Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.
- **Data Encoding**: Transformed categorical data into numerical format for modeling.
  - **Label Encoding**: Applied to the 'sex', 'cabin', and 'embarked' columns.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Built and trained a model to predict survival outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed performance using the following metrics:
  - **Accuracy Score**: 72.9%
  - **Precision Score**: 79.1%
  - **Recall Score**: 79.1%
  - **ROC Curve and AUC**: Analyzed the ROC curve to determine the AUC score.

## Why This Project?
This project illustrates the application of logistic regression for predicting binary outcomes, specifically survival on the Titanic. It covers the complete data pipeline, from handling missing values to applying machine learning techniques for evaluation.
